[% IF report.category == 'Request new container' %]
Due to the current high demand, please allow up to
[% cobrand.wasteworks_config.request_timeframe %] for this
order to be processed. We thank you for your patience and understanding in
advance.

If you have requested a bin, box or caddy to be collected as part of the request:

* Please keep any bin, box or caddy accessible in your front garden or driveway, ready to be exchanged.

* It must be visible from the public highway, so delivery drivers can see it.

* We will not be able to exchange a bin, box or caddy if the old bin is not available, and you may not receive your replacement.

[% IF report.category == 'Report missed collection' %]
We will arrange another collection as soon as possible in the next 2
working days (not including Saturday and Sunday).
[% ELSIF report.category == 'Request new container' %]
We aim to deliver this container to you within
[% cobrand.wasteworks_config.request_timeframe || '20 working days' %]. If

available for collection at the front of your property.
