<h2>How to contact us</h2>

<p>
We are a small, fully remote organisation, so the best way to reach us is to email <strong>press&#64;mysociety.org</strong> and one of the team will respond to you as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Please try to give us as much advance warning as possible for requests to provide comments, interviews or statistics. As a charity, we operate very leanly and with limited resources, so the more time you give us to support your request the better.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note, we can’t respond to queries about reports made on FixMyStreet.</strong>
