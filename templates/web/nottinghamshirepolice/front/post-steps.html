    <h2>Antisocial Behaviour Immediate Justice Scheme
    </h2>
    <p>Nottinghamshire OPCC is one of 16 other PCC areas which has been selected to pilot the ASB Immediate Justice projects. The scheme will provide an opportunity for those who commit low level antisocial behaviour to compensate the community by undertaking supervised reparation activities which help to improve the environment e.g., litter picking, graffiti removal. Offenders will be offered these placements as an alternative to prosecution or current disposals methods which may only mean a verbal or written caution. In this way offenders will payback to the community for their offence which hopefully will provide victims with a sense that justice has been served.
    </p>

    <p>As part of the pilot, the PCC is keen to engage with the communities to give victims, residents, workers and visitors a say in what visible reparation activities they like see undertaken by ASB Offenders. In addition, an opportunity for them to identify suitable locations where they would like to see such activities take place. This website is where this can happen.</p>

    <p>The type of activities offenders can undertake is fairly limited, and the locations you identify may not be suitable, but we will pass on your referral to the relevant local authority if the work is assessed as unsuitable. We will keep you informed of the outcome.
